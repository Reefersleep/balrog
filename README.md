A spike for testing out using `react-dnd` with `hx`.

Currently implements the [chess example from the dnd documentation site](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/docs/tutorial) (without movement limitation).

Builds with [shadow-cljs](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs), so makes all of the environment assumptions that it does.

Run with `npx shadow-cljs watch app`, then open a Chrome browser at http://localhost:3000

Uses html5 dnd, so is not guaranteed to work in other browser than Chrome.

Enjoy!
